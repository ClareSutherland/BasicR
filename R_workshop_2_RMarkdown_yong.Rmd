This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring your analysis output. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Start}

#if you don't have RMarkdown installed, need to install it:
#install.packages("rmarkdown")

#Set working directory 
#Note you need to replace this filepath with your current directory
setwd("/Users/00089951/Dropbox/RTWs/R workshop materials 2019/RWorkshop2")
list.files()

#Load packages
library(psych)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r load dataset}
DuckData <- read.csv("DuckGroups.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "")
str(DuckData)
```

```{r Descriptives}
describe(DuckData$DuckCategPerform)
describeBy(DuckData$DuckCategPerform, group = DuckData$Group)
describeBy(DuckData$DuckCategPerform, group = DuckData$Group, mat = TRUE)
describeBy(DuckData$Phobiascore, group = DuckData$Group, mat = TRUE)
```

```{r T-test}
t.test(DuckCategPerform ~ Group, data = DuckData, var.equal = TRUE)
```

```{r Corr}
DuckPhobicPeople <- DuckData[DuckData$Group == ("DuckPhobic"),]
cor.test(DuckPhobicPeople$DuckCategPerform, DuckPhobicPeople$Phobiascore, method = "pearson")
regresults <- lm(DuckCategPerform ~ Phobiascore, data = DuckPhobicPeople)
summary(regresults)
```

```{r Plots}
#Boxplot for Group differences in Duck Categorisation Performance
ggplot(DuckData, aes(Group,DuckCategPerform)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Duck Phobia Group") + ylab("Categorisation Performance")

#Scatterplot for the relationship between Phobiascore and Duck Categorisation Performance in Duck Phobic People
ggplot(DuckPhobicPeople, aes(DuckCategPerform, Phobiascore)) + geom_point() + xlab("Categorisation score") + ylab("Phobia Score")
```

```{r EXTRA STUFF}

#Between-subjects ANOVA for Group differences in categorization performance
ANOVAmod <- aov(DuckCategPerform ~ Group, data = DuckData)
summary(ANOVAmod)

#Scatterplot for the relationship between Phobiascore and Duck Categorisation Performance in Duck Phobic People with a fitted regression line (the geom_smooth function. lm refers to linear model)
ggplot(DuckPhobicPeople, aes(DuckCategPerform, Phobiascore)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm,se = FALSE) + xlab("Categorisation score") + ylab("Phobia Score")

#Histogram for duck categorisation performance. 
ggplot(DuckData, aes(DuckCategPerform)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.03, alpha=.4) + xlab("Categorisation Performance")

#But wait! There are two groups of participants, LikesDucks and DuckPhobic. Let's use the fill function to colour the histogram so that we know which columns belong to which group.
ggplot(DuckData, aes(DuckCategPerform, fill = Group)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.03, alpha=.4) + xlab("Categorisation Performance")
```
